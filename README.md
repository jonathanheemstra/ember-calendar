# ember-calendar

### What I would do differently
1. Write a timezones service to better handle date and time values for localization.
2. Bring in ember-moment to better handle date and time values directly in the templates.
2. Work with API engineers to include utc as part of day or include timezone data for client to ensure accurate localization.
3. Write tests
4. Better layout - probably more layout specific components.
